## An overview of what problem is being addressed:
The problem being addressed is the global issue of plastic pollution, specifically targeting the pain points associated with recycling plastic bottles in developing countries. The project aims to provide an affordable and efficient solution that encourages recycling while leveraging the power of Hedera and open-source hardware.

## The industry/community the project is trying to help or benefit:
The project aims to benefit both the environment and the communities in developing countries by addressing the issue of plastic pollution. It aims to create a positive impact by providing an affordable and accessible recycling solution, enabling individuals to contribute to a more sustainable future.

## The issue identified for submission:
The main issue identified is the cost and affordability of existing recycling solutions, particularly electronic-based systems that can be expensive for developing countries. The project addresses this issue by utilizing Hedera for rewarding users with HBAR, reducing the cost of electronics to a mere $7.

## Thought process behind the project and how the team thinks this solves the identified problem:
The thought process revolves around creating an accessible and affordable recycling solution by combining open-source hardware and the efficiency of Hedera. By using RFID technology and QR codes, the project simplifies the process of recycling plastic bottles. Users can claim their rewards by scanning the QR code and following a user-friendly interface. By reducing the cost of electronics and leveraging the power of Hedera for rewards, they can make recycling more accessible and incentivize individuals to participate in plastic waste reduction.

## Future plans for the project:
- Automate the production process to generate hundreds of products per minute, making the solution more scalable.
- Decentralize the backend data storage to enhance the security and resilience of the project.
- Conduct pilot tests in developing countries to validate the effectiveness of the solution and gather user feedback.
- Collaborate with local recycling organizations, governments, and NGOs to implement the HedBin system on a larger scale.

## List of tech stack used by the team to build the project:
- Open-source hardware components (RFID reader, microcontroller, servo motor)
- Hedera Hashgraph platform for rewarding users with HBAR
- MongoDB for backend data storage
- Node.js for backend development
- React.js for frontend development
- QR code generation library
- Hashgraph SDK for transactions and reward distribution
